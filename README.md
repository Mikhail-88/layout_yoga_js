# Yoga - landing page

My Solution: 

- [DEMO-LINK](https://mikhail-88.github.io/layout_yoga_js/)

You have complete website layout (index.html and style.css) - make it interactive.
Tasks:

- when you click on button: 'know more' - a modal window should be called;
- inside modal window there is a form. It should be sent via ajax (without reloading the page);
- tabs should be implemented;
- trip cost calculator should be implemented;
- carousel slider should be implemented;
- timer should be implemented.
